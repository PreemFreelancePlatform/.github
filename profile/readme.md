 # Welcome to preem
 
The better freelance platform. I never liked the idea of how other freelance platforms "Vet" their devs based on numbers vs actual work and talent. I envision Preem as a platform that sets itself apart through its onbaording with A community-success driven peer review system. I plan to entrust the responsibility of evaluating talent to the people who understand it best - fellow devs. Additionally, I will incorporate incentives across the platform to ensure honesty and integrity throughout. as well as cool features such as real time job tracking and updates. a intuitive job board bidding and deal system and next level ui. The ultimate goal with Preem is not just to create another freelance platform, but to establish an empowering ecosystem where genuine talent shines, clients receive unparalleled value, and together, we elevate the digital landscape.
